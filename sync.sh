# Synchronize your online Midjourney history with a local copy.

#
# /!\ This requires familiarity with HTTP and the command line. /!\
#
#
#
# - Creates a directory called `jobs` (in the current directory) with a
#   subdirectory for each prompt.
# - All generated images are downloaded to the subdirectory, along with a
#   JSON file containing information about the prompt.
# - Saves a jobs/last.json in case something fails and you need to do
#   manual backups.
# - Safe to re-run if interrupted.
#
# Prerequisities: bash, jq, curl
#
# - Go to https://www.midjourney.com/app
# - Get your user ID from the "view as visitor link (https://www.midjourney.com/app/users/.../)
#   and save it as a file called userid.txt
# - In your browser's dev tools, find the `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` cookie.
# - Run `./sync.sh` from the directory *containing* your jobs dir (or where
#   you want one to be added)
